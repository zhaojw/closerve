closerve
========

CloServe is a view first web framework in Clojure. It is inspired by the [Lift web framework](http://liftweb.net)

Contrubution by:

- [Jiawei Zhao](https://github.com/zhaojw)
- [MKRRF IT Limited](http://www.mkrrf-it.com), provided some of the code used in [CloEDIT](http://www.mkrrf-it.com/cloedit/)

## Installation
Currently I have not setup a clojar download yet. You need to git clone this project to your local disk.
Then run:

```lein clean```

```lein cljsbuild once```

```lein install```

This will add CloServe to your local maven repo.

In your project that use CloServe, you can add to project.clj file dependencies:

```
[closerve "0.3.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

[Example Code](https://github.com/zhaojw/closerve-example)

[Running Example](http://closerve.mkrrf-it.com/lazyload)

##Change from 0.2.0-SNAPSHOT to 0.3.0-SNAPSHOT
change to use immutant

##Breaking change from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0
register-lift-snippet macro's lift-instr parameter used to be: {:name SnippetName, :params {...}}
Now it is just the :params part, so for eg, in 0.1.0 code, to get a lift parameter, the call is:

```(get-in lift-instr [:params "SomeParameter"])```

Now it is:

```(lift-instr "SomeParameter")```

## Current Status
This project is in very beta stage. Quite some debug message will be thrown to the console. The apis could
change a lot in the future. Could have security issuses as well. 

It is quite functional though, so I am using it to run my own website [MKRRF IT](http://www.mkrrf-it.com).

## Acknowledgements

In addition to a lot of fantastic Clojure libraries (jetty7-websockets-async, core.async, ring,
hickory, jayq, clojurescript, crypto-random ..., a lot is learnt from 
[torus-pong](https://github.com/uswitch/torus-pong) about cljs and ws.
